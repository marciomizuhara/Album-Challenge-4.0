# Album Challenge 4.0
This is a Discord bot I created for my discord music server. 
It was built around the idea of having a music challenge on the server, and it works as follows:
* Users can add album releases to the bot, which comprises all submissions into a list; 
* Then users can roll the dice and get an album randomly from the server. They have 24 hours to listen to this album and submit a review or a rating;
* The bot storages all data and, from that point on, is able to return some exploratory data analyses, such as return top 10 rated albums, filter albums by year, genre, number of reviews, among others.

## How to Use
The bot was mainly developed to be used with Replit (replit.com/) as it's hosted there and uses Replit's Database. This is a key-value database type, so it could be easily adapted to other platforms.
Either way, this freeCodeCamp tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org contains all information needed to host a discord bot on Replit.

## Getting started
* First of all, the 2022 releases list should be populated. Just run the command !newalbum** - ARTIST - ALBUM - SPOTIFY**, as follows:<br/><br/>

* Optionally, you can set genres to the album by running the command !setgenre ID GENRE<br/><br/>
